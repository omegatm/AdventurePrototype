A simple adventure game by {Joseph Verespey} based on a simple adventure game engine by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly).

Code requirements:
- **4+ scenes based on `AdventureScene`**: underlake,castle,heart,innerforest,Demo1.
- **2+ scenes *not* based on `AdventureScene`**: Intro,Outro.
- **2+ methods or other enhancement added to the adventure game engine to simplify my scenes**:
    - Combining Items(making poison bait).
    - Changed message positioning to fit longer frame text titles.

Experience requirements:
- **4+ locations in the game world**: underlake,castle,heart,innerforest,Demo1.
- **2+ interactive objects in most scenes**:Cheese, shield.
- **Many objects have `pointerover` messages**: sheol,cheese
- **Many objects have `pointerdown` effects**: Lake, Heart
- **Some objects are themselves animated**: Heart, Fish

Asset sources:
- All sprites were drawn by me in Aseprite. Backgrounds are (intentionally) low resolution screenshots I took in the game Oblivion (Sheol is basically me drawing Sheogorath from memory);

Code sources:
- `adventure.js` and `index.html` were created for this project [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly) and edited by me.
- `game.js` was sketched by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly) and rewritten by me.
